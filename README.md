## Overview

VisionFit applies computer vision techniques to analyze training videos and extract key performance metrics.
By tracking barbell and body motion, the system calculates velocity, power, fatigue, and consistency.
A web-based dashboard then visualizes these results and provides AI-generated analysis for the athlete.

## Core Features

Computer vision lift analysis using OpenCV

Calculation of average and max bar speed, fatigue index, power output, and time under tension

AI-generated lift feedback

Athlete dashboard with lift history, visual graphs, and performance summaries

Diet dashboard with a daily macro tracker, food log, and AI-analysis on food for a given goal
